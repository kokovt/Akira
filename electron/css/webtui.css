 * @file Main CSS Entry Point & Layer Definition
 * @summary This file establishes the foundational CSS architecture for the application.
 * @description It utilizes CSS Cascade Layers (`@layer`) to create a structured and
 * predictable styling system. It then imports the full stylesheet from the
 * WebTUI CSS library, which provides the base styles for the UI components
 * seen in the application.
 */

/**
 * Defines the cascade layers for the entire application's CSS.
 * By defining the order here, we gain explicit control over style precedence,
 * making it easier to manage and override styles.
 * The order is significant:
 * 1. `base`: Intended for resets, default element styles (e.g., body, h1).
 * 2. `utils`: For utility classes (e.g., .text-center, .p-4) and, in this case, the imported library.
 * 3. `components`: For custom application-specific component styles (e.g., .chat-bubble, .sidebar-user).
 * Styles in `components` will override styles in `utils` and `base`, regardless of selector specificity.
